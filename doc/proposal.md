The goal of this project is to build a locker that employs various features such as facial recognition, automatic lock, and data-driven technology that keeps track of user interactions. We selected this project because we desire to create a product thatâ€™s not only fun and lighthearted but also represents the college experience. Nothing comes close to as iconic and recognizable as the school locker and engineering students, we desire to exercise our skills and see how far we can re-invent the locker using electronic technology.

This project comprises both computer and electrical engineering skillsets, so to successfully reach our goal, we intend on using different components ranging from  

Potential Features: 
Facial Recognition
Automatic Lock
Screen Display ( time, date, etc)
Manuel open: Emergency access
Can add more features as progress
